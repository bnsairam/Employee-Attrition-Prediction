# Employee Attrition Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts whether an employee is likely to leave a company (attrition) using machine learning. It employs a Random Forest Classifier from scikit-learn to model attrition based on features such as age, years at company, job satisfaction, monthly salary, and promotion history. Visualizations created with seaborn display the distribution of attrition probabilities and feature importance. A bonus section in the script allows loading real-world HR data from a CSV or mock API endpoint.

## Technologies
- Python 3.8+
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- requests (for API integration, optional)

## Features
- Predicts employee attrition using a Random Forest Classifier.
- Visualizes attrition probability distribution with a histogram.
- Displays feature importance to identify key predictors of attrition.
- Supports loading real-world HR data from a CSV or API.

## Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
